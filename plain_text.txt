As part of the GBS integration testing the new RBM hardware configuration with the currently fielded software of GRS Client v6.0.4.373 is required to complete testing with PMW 160’s Application Integration (AI) Consolidated Afloat Networks and Enterprise Services (CANES) to ensure GBS data and video products are distributed to the end user systems properly. The testing will also verify,  specific Navy GBS Sources such as the Navy Asymmetric Network configuration for Automated Digital Network System (ADNS) Secret Internet Protocol Routing Network (SIPRNet) data known as Navy Split Internet Protocol (IP). The purpose of the AISIT Test Plan for the AN/USR-10B(V) is to document all test expectations, requirements, resources, etc. that must be satisfied before and during the test event. A key component of the application/ system test plan is the identification of test objectives, e.g., Key Performance Parameters (KPPs), Key Support Areas (KSAs), and Information Exchange Requirements (IERs) that will be tested for during the System Integration Test (SIT). The test plan should provide a traceability matrix to the supporting test cases and/or test procedures that will be used during the test event.OBJECTIVEThe desired outcome of this event is to reduce the risk for integration and interoperability between the GBS RBM and the CANES UNCLASSIFIED (UNCLASS), SECRET, SECRET Releasable (SR), and Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) enclaves, and all other applications/systems that will operate in this environment for the targeted platform type.SCOPEThe scope of this SIT document is limited to testing with the GBS RBM during AISIT-7. It also includes testing requirements of interfaces with required supported or related systems to include Automated Digital Network System (ADNS), Navy Information/Application Product Suite (NIAPS), Navy Integrated Tactical Environment System (NITES) - Next, Global Command and Control System - Maritime (GCCS-M), CANES, Defense Common Ground System - Navy (DCGS-N), Simple Message Queue (SMQ) -11, Classified Video Distribution System (CVDS), Geographical Intelligence Unified Naval Streaming System (GUNSS), Integrated Broadcast Service (IBS), Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) and The Intelligence Carry-On Program (ICOP). TEST SCHEDULEThe high-level test schedule with milestones is shown in the table below.

GBS provides the rapid dissemination of live video, large data files and other information to warfighters for: intelligence; reconnaissance; weapons targeting; special requirements; and training exercises.SYSTEM DESCRIPTIONTransmit SegmentThe primary Satellite Broadcast Manager (SBM) located at a Defense Enterprise Computing Center (DECC) facility is located in Oklahoma City, OK (OKC), with the backup SBM at a DECC facility is located in Mechanicsburg, PA (MECH) which is designed as a Continuity of Operations (COOP) location. Data and streaming products are transmitted from sources to the GBS primary SBM at the DECC facility (videos are simultaneously transmitted to the COOP  SBM at the MECH DECC facility) and then across the Department of Defense Information Network (DoDIN) core to DoD Teleports, DoD Gateways, and terminals for broadcast over the WGS satellites (Ka- & X-bands).The GBS architecture is a content priority based broadcast. This ensures the most critical information is delivered first. The IP architecture allows higher content priority products to interrupt the broadcast of lower priority broadcasts after which the delivery of lower level priority content will resume. GBS is a MAC-II Level information technologies mission-essential national security system providing network centric communications. GBS does not have nuclear survivability or hardening features incorporated. GBS is vulnerable to the same threats as most commercial SATCOM systems.Space SegmentThe space segment consists of GBS broadcast streams utilizing bandwidth on WGS satellites (1-7). Other X-, Ka- and Ku-band satellites, US and non-US, could also be used to augment the space segment if necessary.Receive SegmentThe receive segment provides the capability of receiving the GBS broadcast signal, extracting the information products of interest to local forces, and disseminating the products to the forces using local network/communications infrastructure. The receive segment, referred to as the Receive Broadcast Manager (RBM), is on a common architecture configured for transportable, shipboard, subsurface, and airborne applications.Spilt IP OverviewGBS Split IP allows an asymmetric communication path with the RBM where the ADNS SIPRNet forward data signal flows over the high bandwidth unidirectional GBS system and the return ADNS SIPRNet data signal flows over the ADNS assigned primary path bandwidth links. Split IP automatically detects when there is a high bandwidth GBS forward link available and automatically configures the ADNS SIPRNet to route the forward traffic through GBS. It leverages the existing ship satellite communications to determine when a link is available. It also leverages existing GBS scheduling services to configure the SBM (Satellite Broadcast Manager) to route the Split IP Streaming Service Source to the appropriate transponder.When Split IP is turned on and the Shipboard / submarine end user requests data from an External Website, the request goes from the End User computer through ADNS to the Fleet Router in the NOC (Network Operating Center). From the Fleet router the request goes through the SIPRNet to the External website. On the return path to the ship/sub end user BGP Router re-routes the packets destined for the End User through the Fleet router using Quagga on the Split IP server. This is where the GBS data encapsulation begins. In the encapsulation process, the data starts as an IP packet from Quagga on the Split IP server. OpenVPN (Virtual Private Network) is configured to have one tunnel per a Kencast channel. Based on which transponder the end user box is located under, Quagga routes IP packets destined for the end user box into the corresponding OpenVPN tunnel. It then gets encapsulated by OpenVPN from a TCP packet to a UDP packet to prepare for one way delivery of the data. Then Fazzt Enterprise Server encapsulates the OpenVPN packet into a Fazzt transport stream. One Fazzt transport stream is configured per an OpenVPN tunnel to encapsulate any data that goes into the corresponding OpenVPN tunnel. The transport streams travel over the Fazzt Enterprise Server channels to the SBM via GRE tunnel. While in the SBM the Fazzt Enterprise Server transport streams are forwarded to the appropriate transponder.The SBM encrypts the broadcast using Type 1 encryption for the classified enclave as well as CAS Type 2 encryption for the unclassified enclave and then sends the Kencast Channel product to the RBM over the high bandwidth satellite. The type 1 decryptor on the RBM removes the broadcast encapsulation leaving the Fazzt transport stream identified as Split IP Channel xxx.Then Kencast on the RBM removes the Fazzt transport stream encapsulation leaving the OpenVPN tunnel. The OpenVPN client on the RBM removes the OpenVPN tunnel encapsulation changing the UDP packets back into TCP packets leaving the original data reply. Then the data is passed as an IP packet onto the appropriate network server which finally delivers to the ADNS SIPRNet to complete the data path. This full circuit architecture is displayed in figure 1 and 2 for ADNS INC III and ADNS INC II./Figure 21 UNCLASS System Boundary/Figure 22 SECRET System BoundaryKey Features And SubsystemsMajor hardware and software are listed in table 2-1. Table 21 List of Feature and SubsystemsDeviceManufacturerFunctionModel NumberSoftware VersionComputerGermaneRBMGRS1317D-RY01-2GBS 6.XSwitchAlcatelNetwork switch6855-U24X6.4.6.361.R01SwitchCiscoSplit IP RouterCISCO 291115.0 (2) SE7ServerDellSplit IP serverR330RHEL 6ServerDellSBM Shore serverPowerEdgeR515Microsoft (MS) Windows Server 2003 R2Physical InterfacesPhysical and logical interfaces are listed in table 22.Table 22 Physical InterfacesApplication/SystemInterface ClassPhysical Interface ConnectionInterface typeStandards/ ProtocolsADNS INC IIIUNCLASSG 1/.108Gigabit EthernetTCP, UDP, Simultaneous Media Access Control (MAC) Transfer Protocol (SMPT), Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)ADNS INC IIISECRETG 1/.108Gigabit EthernetTCP, UDP, SMPT, SNMP, ESPFleet Router Media Converter SwitchSECRETG 0/2Gigabit EthernetTCP, UDP, SMPT, SNMP, ESPLogical InterfacesPhysical and Logical Interfaces are listed in table 23.Table 23 Logical InterfacesApplication/SystemData TransmittedDirectionCANES (U/S)File Transfer Protocol (FTP), TCP, Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS), UDP, SNMP, SMTP, ESPBidirectionalDCGS-NFTP, HTTPS, HTTPBidirectionalSMQ-11FTP, HTTPS, HTTPBidirectionalHBSSTCP, HTTP, HTTPS, UDP, SNMPBidirectionalIBSUDP / ESPBidirectionalNITES-NEXTFTP, SFTPBidirectionalGUNSSUDPUnidirectionalGCCS-MTCP, UDPBidirectional NIAPSFTP, SFTP, FTPSBidirectionalICOPTCP, UDPBidirectionalTEST OVERVIEWPREVIOUS TEST EVENTSThe AN/USR-10B(V) and AN/USR-10A(V) both support the previous AISIT-5 with both RBM’s utilizing the latest GRS Client version to support the SIT with CANES requirements.SATISFACTORY/UNSATISFACTORYAll previous test events with CANES and the AN/USR-10A(V) and AN/USR-10B(V) RBM’s have been satisfactory.
